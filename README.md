# React + Vite
Step 1

clone the repository to your system and open the terminal window in VS Code. This automatically means you're at the root of your project.

Step 2

Install Dependencies: Run "npm install" to install all dependencies listed in the package.json file.

Step 3

Run the command "npm run dev" in your terminal and the site will start running on localhost.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
